            <img id="myPhoto" src="assets/images/me.png" alt="photo of me" />
            <p>In 2014, I graduated from the University of South Carolina with a Bachelors degree in Advertising. Soon after
                graduation I headed up to New York City for an internship with the advertising agency, BBDO. While there
                I worked with a small new business team on various pitches. Six months later I was ready to explore a new
                part of the country, the lovely midwest, so I moved to Chicago and took another agency job at Ogilvy and
                Mather. I stayed with the company for three years working in account management. During that time I uncovered
                an interest in coding and began to dabble on my own. I'm now attending the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp and
                pursuing a career as a web developer. </p>

            <p>I live in Wrigleyville with my boyfriend of five years and dog of six. When I find myself with some free time,
                I enjoy reading, painting on the rare occassion when I have enough time, playing frisbee with the pup, Hiccup,
                and eating pizza.
